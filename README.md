## Introduction

In this repository you will find different exercises for the fundamentals of Deep Learning, such as Multilayer Perceptrons, Optimization and Regularization techniques, or CNN's. 

The MNIST dataset is located in the root of the repo. In order to train the different algorithms, you need to copy the dataset to the python file location.
